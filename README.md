# The-Smart-Glove
We plan to build a special glove which when worn by a mute person, will automatically read their sign language and convert it into speech in real time, so that a normal person will be able to understand them better.
<h2><b>Workflow DESCRIPTION</b></h2>
<p>
  We plan to use arduino and sensors to read data from glove and transfer it to users mobile phone to decode it and convert it into English.

<h2><b>Working</b></h2>
<p>Glove is equipped with LDR sensors which sense the movements of hands and transfer the data to user’s phone via bluetooth.<br>

<br>
Once data is received in phone, it is then decoded via an app and is shown in plain text English.
English text is then converted into speech on the fly.
</p>
<h2>Application Mode</h2>
<p>
<h3>App will have two modes :</h3>
      <li>
  <ol>Deaf Mode :   When used by a deaf person, he will be 			  		    able to read what other person is saying in his 				    mobile screen.</ol>
	<ol>Mute Mode :  When used by a mute person, he will be able to 				    use gestures to communicate with the other 				    person.</ol>
  </li>

<h2><b>Deaf Mode</b></h2>
<pre>In deaf mode, user will be able to use the app’s inbuilt  speech recognizer.
Speech will be converted into text on the fly on users screen even without internet connection.
This will enable deaf people to read what the other person is saying in realtime.
